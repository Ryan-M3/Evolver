# Evolver

This is my attempt at creating the software evolution experiment described at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tierra_(computer_simulation). It was surprisingly successful, which means RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK. I used a virtual machine to run this software and virtual box itself regularly crashed (rather than the operating system).
